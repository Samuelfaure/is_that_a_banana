How many times did you want to eat a delicious banana just to realize it was
actually a door, a table or even another person ?
Well, suffer no more !

This deeplearning project helps you identify bananas on pics.

Just take a picture of your item, then drag-and-drop it.

Live demo [here](http://www.isthatabanana.com/).

Use [deeplearn.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) with SqueezeNet.
